# Unity-ReorderableList-Property-Drawer

A small Unity Editor extension that enables Reorderable Lists instead of the Default Lists in Unity 2019 (and older). It is meant for those who need just Reorderable Lists and don't want to use Odin and other complex solutions.

Works out of the box, just export the package. Voil√†!
